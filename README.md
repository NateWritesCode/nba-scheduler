# NBA Scheduler

NBA schedule generator written in Typescript. Borrows heavily from the [nba-scheduler](https://github.com/jackconnolly21/nba-scheduler) project written in Python.

This schedule generator will be used in the forthcoming [Basketball Simulator](https://github.com/NateWritesCode/basketball-simulator) application.
